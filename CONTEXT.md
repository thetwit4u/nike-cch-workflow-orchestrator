# Gemini CLI Session Context

## Objective

The primary goal of this session was to ensure that the `CchSystemEvent` consistently contains the full, accumulated `businessContext` throughout the entire workflow lifecycle, with a special focus on correcting the context for asynchronous operations.

## Key Issues Addressed

1.  **Incomplete Context in Async Events:**
    *   **Problem:** The `AsyncRequestStarted` and `AsyncRequestEnded` events were only including the context of the specific async step, not the full workflow state.
    *   **Solution:** The logic in `orchestrator/service.py` and `orchestrator/nodes/capability_nodes.py` was modified to ensure the complete, merged state is passed to the `EventPublisher` for these events.

2.  **`_deep_merge_dict` TypeError:**
    *   **Problem:** A `TypeError` occurred because `_deep_merge_dict` was being called as an instance method (`self._deep_merge_dict(...)`) but was defined as a static method.
    *   **Solution:** The `@staticmethod` decorator was added to the `_deep_merge_dict` function definition in `orchestrator/service.py`.

3.  **Filtering of Internal Keys:**
    *   **Problem:** Internal-use keys (like `_no_cache`) were appearing in the final `businessContext` because the filtering logic had been mistakenly removed during a previous fix.
    *   **Solution:** The filtering logic (`if not k.startswith('_')`) was restored in the `_build_event` function within `orchestrator/event_publisher.py` to correctly remove these keys from the `businessContext` before publishing.

## Current Status

All identified issues have been addressed. The system should now correctly publish events with the complete and properly filtered business context at all stages of the workflow.
